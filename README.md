# Employee Attrition Analysis – Green Destinations

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition at Green Destinations, a travel agency experiencing increased employee turnover. The objective is to identify key factors influencing attrition and build a predictive machine learning model.

## Objectives
- Calculate employee attrition rate
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify factors affecting attrition
- Build and optimize machine learning models
- Provide actionable HR insights

## Dataset
- Records: 1,470 employees
- Features: Demographic, job-related, salary, and experience attributes
- Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
3. Feature Encoding  
4. Model Building:
   - Logistic Regression (baseline)
   - Random Forest (optimized)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Feature Importance Analysis

## Results
- Attrition Rate: ~16%
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression
- Key drivers of attrition:
  - Monthly Income
  - Years at Company
  - Age
  - Overtime
  - Job Satisfaction

## Business Insights
- High attrition among early-tenure employees
- Lower income correlates with higher attrition
- Work-life balance significantly impacts retention

## Conclusion
The analysis helps HR teams proactively identify high-risk employees and design better retention strategies.
